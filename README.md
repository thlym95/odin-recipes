Beginning of Odin Recipes Project, quick prep recipes.
Some of the recipes will be from:
- PickUpLimes (https://www.youtube.com/@PickUpLimes/videos)
- Maangchi (https://www.youtube.com/@Maangchi)

And one is a family tip for lavender honey.

For this first part, the main goal is to organize the information architecture and understand the general construction of websites outside online builders I've learned from before. (Which!! are amazing and I'm grateful towards, but learning how to use the terminal has saved me now.)

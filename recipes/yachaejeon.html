       <h3>Pancake:</h3>
        <li>Heat up a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Add about 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and swirl it around to coat the skillet evenly. Add the batter to the skillet and spread it out evenly.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to medium and put the sliced mushroom on top. Gently press them in with a wooden spoon or spatula.</li>
        <li>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the bottom turns crunchy light golden brown. Grab the handle of the skillet and twirl it around so the pancake moves and is cooked evenly underneath.</li>
        <li>Turn or flip over the pancake.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium high and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil along the edges of the pancake. Lift up one edge with your spatula and tilt the skillet so the oil flows underneath the pancake.</li>
        <li>Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until both sides turn light golden brown, occasionally pressing down with the spatula.</li>
        <li>Flip it over one more time and cook another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer it to a large plate and serve right away with the dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Preparation steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil in a heavy pot over high heat and add the beef and garlic.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to medium, cover, and cook for 20 to 25 minutes until the  beef  is  tender and  has  infused  the water  with  flavor.</li>
        <li>Roast both sides of a sheet of seaweed until it's bright green and very crispy. Crush it in a bag.</li>
        <li>Separate two eggs, putting yolks and whites into separate bowls. Add pinch of salt to each and mix with a fork.</li>
        <li>Heat a thin layer of oil, turn off the heat. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the pan and tilt it so it spreads evenly and thinly. Let it cook on the hot pan for about 1 minute. Flip it over and let it sit on the pan for another minute, then take it off, slice it into thin strips and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add the rice cake slices to the boiling soup along with fish sauce and salt. Stir it with a ladle. Cover and let it cook for 7 to 8 minutes until all the rice cakes are floating and softened.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg whites by little by little into the soup and cook for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add sesame oil, ground black pepper, and chopped green onion. Stir the soup. Remove from the heat and ladle the rice cake soup into individual serving bowls.</li>
        <li>Garnish with yellow egg strips, crushed seaweed, and red pepper if you want.</li>
    </ol>
